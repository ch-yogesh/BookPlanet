# BookPlanet
Some colleges library has limited number of books of particular subjects, at the exam time some students doesnâ€™t
got books to prepare for exam and also there is no common platform where students can look for previous year papers of
all subjects, so designed a single portal for all the stuffs. Project focuses on registering the students of different branches, and
everyone can got books and previous year papers for their practice.

The technologies that i used in pwojects are:-

Android:- The project named Book Planet developed in Android. The main motive to choose the Android as a platform is that Android covers 75% of the market.

XML:- The front-end of the application is written in XML. Android by default  supports XML so there is no other choice to write the front-end.

Java:- Java is simple and open source, and officially supported by Android. The backend of the application is written in Java. 

SQLite:- SQLite is a relational database that generally follows the syntax of PostgreSQL. It is light weight and fast database.

I completed that project during training.
